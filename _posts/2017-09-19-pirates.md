# International Talk Like A Pirate Day

# Data

I thought I had seen data on historical shipping, and also piracy somewhere a while ago, but I cannot find it any more. So, I'll grab data from Wikipedia again, since it's available! There is a [list of famous pirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_pirates); it's biased, of course. I see relatively few entries on Babary pirates, for instance. No matter, the list covers most of the Golden Age of Piracy, and I'll use it to generate a dataset on the caribbean pirates.

Behold, 1200 years of cherry blossom history!

# Concluding remarks

The code is available on [github](https://github.com/safferli/pirates), as always.
